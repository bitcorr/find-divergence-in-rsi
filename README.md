# find-divergence-in-rsi
This code helps identify tops and bottoms and find rsi divergence in price action.
The identification of tops & bottoms is made by taking the MA of a the price, smoothing it and then the changes in the gradient are the tops & bottoms. Large MA will give us tops and bottoms of the big pictures (will capture big movements- which is usually what we search for) and small MA will capture more t&b as it capture smaller moves.
